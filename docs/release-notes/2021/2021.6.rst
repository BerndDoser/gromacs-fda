Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do not try to guess atom names in ``gmx rms`` unless needed
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Guessing atomic masses based on atom names may sometimes fail.
When ``-nomw`` switch is used, atom masses are not needed, but ``gmx rms``
was trying to guess them anyway, throwing a fatal error when an unknown 
element was encountered. Now, the error is only raised when masses are
actually needed.

Fixes that affect portability

Miscellaneous
